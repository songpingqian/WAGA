# WAGA （Weighted Attention Gene Analysis）
A deep learning-based approach that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for protein-coding gene feature representation, combined with deep learning and Self-Attention (SA) mechanisms, aims at identifying key genes involved in freshwater and seawater acclimatization in fish.

For the implementation code：make sure you have installed Pytorch, busco, orthofinder and other relevant python packages.


All the step-by-step information and code in WAGA is in Fish_BPe.ipynb; 
If you need to run a splitter: python BPE.py; 
If you need to do word embeddings: python Word2vec.py; 
If you need to do a vectorial representation of the samples: python Vector_run.py; 
If you need to train the WAGA model: If you need to train a WAGA model: python train.py, but remember to change the path;
